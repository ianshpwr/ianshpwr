## Hi, I’m Ansh Pawar

I specialize in building intelligent systems powered by LLM APIs and crafting responsive frontends that integrate AI to deliver smarter, more interactive experiences.

### What I’m Working On

- Building AI agents using Gemini API, Groq, and other LLM platforms  
- Evaluating and comparing LLM responses for reasoning quality and performance  
- Designing agent workflows with feedback loops, chaining, and automation logic  
- Prototyping tools and experiments with Gradio, Jupyter Notebooks, and Aceternity  
- Creating intuitive UIs using React, shadcn/ui, and AI-enhanced interactions  

### Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript  
- **LLM & AI APIs:** Gemini, Groq, OpenAI, Replicate  
- **Frontend & UI:** React, shadcn/ui, Aceternity  
- **Prototyping:** Gradio, Jupyter Notebook, FastAPI  
- **Data & Utilities:** Pandas, NumPy, Git  

### Open to Collaborations On

- Agent systems and LLM research  
- Intelligent, AI-powered web tools  
- Real-world applications that combine UI with generative intelligence  
- Open-source contributions around LLM orchestration and evaluation  

### Goals

- Build adaptive, production-ready agentic systems  
- Blend frontend development with AI for seamless smart applications  
- Contribute to meaningful, open-source AI infrastructure
